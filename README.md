=======

This is a time ontology for describing temporal sociocultural events, particulary in Senegal (West Africa).
Files can be used with CORESE (https://wimmics.inria.fr/corese) which is a Semantic Web Factory (triple store & SPARQL endpoint) implementing RDF, RDFS, SPARQL 1.1 Query & Update. 

To test it, one can upload data.ttl file on Corese and also rule.rul file. In query.rq file one has a set of queries for testing data.
